hello!! 

DNI PROSHIP & DSMP. YOU FUCKERS SMELL RANCID.

not going to make this all fancy for now, just going to give the basics.
c+h (cuddle plus hide) on ponytown is WELCOMED ALL DAY EVERYDAY! i'm a bit of an awkward, reserved person so i might not say much but i still appreciate when people sit with me.

w2i (whisper to interact) is preferred, because i am usually tabbed out and will feel bad if i find out you said something to me and i missed it. it has happened countless times before.

big into a lot of things, mainly PHIGHTING (banhammer main).. my favorite character(s) are valk, venomshank, windforce, and subspace! a majority of my favorite characters are NPCs it's kind of funny. yes this is important information it had to be shared.
*anyways would absolutely shit bricks if one of those aformentioned fellas stopped by... that's just a suggestion, though! also i engage in oc x canon so... heh... im normal LFMLASPOSDAOPK*

 i despise people who talk down on others just for having innocent fun. like you freaks are SO miserable so you have to make sure everyone else around you feels as badly as you do. it's insanely weird! (this is oddly specific BECAUSE i've seen it happen and it's just extremely cringe. i dont vibe w/ that shit AT ALL.)

 if i get comfortable around you, i'll probably get excited very easily... especially if you enjoy something that i enjoy. like i'll slap my keyboard so hard i'll accidentally open 5 different tabs while simultaneously closing pony town. it's happened, it's possible.

 that's all, see ya! maybe consider leaving a message on my atabook OR checking out my sentry! thanks for reading. :-) <3
